# Lending Club Application

The lending club application will make use of Tableau as a medium to deploy an app. The R script in the repository will:

1. Load the H2O library and launch a H2O instance.
2. Load the data into H2O.
3. Build a model that determines whether a new incoming loan application is likely to default on the loan or not.
4. Predict on new incoming loan data to report whether the new loan request has been approved or denied.

## The Original Data

The **Lending Club Data** used for the application can be accessed the [Lending Club site](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) and to access the secure dataset used in this demo you'll need a Lending Club account.
